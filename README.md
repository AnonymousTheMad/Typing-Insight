Typing Insight: Your Personal Communication Coach

 
What is Typing Insight?

**Typing Insight** is a new feature for your smartphone keyboard that turns your daily typing into a **personal communication coach**. It silently analyzes your typing habits, phrases, and errors to give you a simple, weekly report on your communication style and efficiency.

Imagine finally knowing the unconscious patterns in how you type from the phrases you repeat most often to the keys you always seem to mistype.

### Why Typing Insight Matters

The way we communicate online is often unconscious. We use the same phrases, make the same errors, and don't realize it.

* **Gain Awareness:** Typing Insight solves the problem of unconscious communication patterns by making your linguistic style and efficiency visible without any active effort.
* **Improve Efficiency:** By highlighting repetitive phrases and frequent spelling mistakes, you can become more concise and fix bad typing habits.
* **A Private Coach:** All the analysis happens **locally on your device**, meaning your typing data and reports are completely private and secure.

### Who is it For?

* **Professionals:** Who want to be more efficient and precise in their digital communication.
* **Students:** Looking to diversify their vocabulary and eliminate common writing mistakes.
* **Anyone:** Who uses a smartphone keyboard and wants to understand and improve their digital communication habits.
